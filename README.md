Kumusta!  I'm Joseph. I'm a Doctoral Researcher at the UKRI Center for Doctoral Training in Accountable, Responsible, and Transparent AI (also called ART-AI) at the University of Bath. I conduct research in NLP specifically in the areas of text complexity, language generation, and low-resource corpus building and evaluation.
