## Doctoral Researcher in Responsible AI and Natural Language Processing 🧑‍💻

Kumusta!  I'm Joseph. I'm a Doctoral Researcher at the UKRI Center for Doctoral Training in Accountable, Responsible, and Transparent AI (also called ART-AI) at the University of Bath. I conduct research in technical AI alignment, standardization and control, and low-resource corpus building and evaluation. Before moving to the British countryside of Bath 🇬🇧, I previously resided in Manila, Philippines 🇵🇭 where I finished my MS in Computer Science at De La Salle University and my BS at Bicol University.
